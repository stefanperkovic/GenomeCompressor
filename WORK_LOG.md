| November 13 | 3:40-4:40pm |                                     I reviewed the slides and looked at the google docs instructions since I was sick and didn't learn about it in class. Though about how I am going to convert the chars into binary bits. I remembered how in our initial DNA discussion we talked about assigning each letter 2 bit value like 01 or 00. Started to think about how to implement that. |
| November 13 | 4:40 - 5:10 | I wrote the compress() function by implementing a switchcase for each nucleotide in the DNA sequence. That way we can associate each char A, C, T, and G that is 8 bits into a 2 bits code. This should compress and save a lot of space and cut the total space in a quarter. This works because we know our data is going to be only 4 different letters so why store extra information. |
| November 13 | 5:10 - 5:40 |                             I completed the expand() function to convert these 2-bit representation of nucleotides back into chars through a few else-if statements. However, it is not passing the tests and is showing differences in the files after compression and expansion. I think that extra bits are getting padded somewhere but I am not sure exactly where and how to fix it. |
| November 14 |  2:30-3:00  |                                       I am working on implementing so that at the start of each binary sequence we have an integer to represent how many chars we are going to need and the bits to store so that we can prevent warping. I am also working on creating a map for my nucleotides and for the bits instead of the switch case so that we can achieve constant time lookups. |
| November 16 | 5:00 - 5:30 |                                                                Completed both the compress and expand classes and they worked sucesfully. I finished the maps for constant time lookups. I changed the one in compress to a map of chars so that I wouldn't have to change it later. Made them for-loops so that they only go the length of the sequence to avoid warping. Added comments. |
