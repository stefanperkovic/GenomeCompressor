| November 13 | 3:40-4:40pm |                                     I reviewed the slides and looked at the google docs instructions since I was sick and didn't learn about it in class. Though about how I am going to convert the chars into binary bits. I remembered how in our initial DNA discussion we talked about assigning each letter 2 bit value like 01 or 00. Started to think about how to implement that. |
| November 13 | 4:40 - 5:10 | I wrote the compress() function by implementing a switchcase for each nucleotide in the DNA sequence. That way we can associate each char A, C, T, and G that is 8 bits into a 2 bits code. This should compress and save a lot of space and cut the total space in a quarter. This works because we know our data is going to be only 4 different letters so why store extra information. |
