| November 13 | 3:40-4:40pm | I reviewed the slides and looked at the google docs instructions since I was sick and didn't learn about it in class. Though about how I am going to convert the chars into binary bits. I remembered how in our initial DNA discussion we talked about assigning each letter 2 bit value like 01 or 00. Started to think about how to implement that. |
